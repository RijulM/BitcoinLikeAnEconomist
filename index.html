<h1 style ="text-align:center">A Simple Expanation of Bitcoin</h1>
<p>
<br>After explaining bitcoin a few times I've found the best way think about it (like most things) is as an Economist.
<br>
<br>The properties of anything identified as "money" include:
<br>-Store of value
<br>...Will it hold its value over time?
<br>-Medium of exchange
<br>...Can I use it as an intermediary in exchanging goods/services to get what I want?
<br>-Unit of Account
<br>...(essentially) Can it be measured as a discrete value? (as opposed to continuous)
<br>
<br>Think of the dollar as a  "promissory note" which doesn't hold value itself. It promises the  
<br>bearer of the note a certain amount of gold, held in a bank's reserves. Over time, as 
<br>the note became used by more and more people, the note itself could be exchanged. The merchant had 
<br>so much faith the note would be backed by gold, he was willing to accept the note in exchange for his
<br>goods. Finally, the note itself was so accepted, the gold backing was removed. 
<br>
<br>A bitcoin follows the same three properties. If the architecture regarding the coin and its distribution
<br>are sound, people will begin to place faith in it for transacting. If there are certain advantages to 
<br>transacting in bitcoin (i.e. anonymity or greater percieved store of value), it will compete favorably
<br>against other currencies and its adoption will spread. The dollar value of bitcoin can be thought of as
<br>an account of its ability to satisfy the three properties of money.
<br>
<br>Note: This analysis ignores speculation.
<br>
<br>Bitcoin has a Blockchain, a global ledger of every transaction  in history. A transaction is conducted between 
<br>wallets, alphanumeric identifiers which are (at least speciously) difficult to attribute to a person.  A Bitcoin miner
<br>(the human with the computing equipment) donates his computing power and pays for electricity, hoping in turn
<br>he will get a bitcoin. To the miner, a bitcoin is a reward for adding an additional page to the ledger so 
<br>additional people can transact. If I was to try to send you a coin, I would need to wait for a page to be added
<br>to validate our transaction.
<br>
<br>Bitcoins are limited, and computation becomes harder (i.e. costs more electricity/time) over time. Once the supply
<br>has run out, miners will mine for a "transaction fee" from the people who use the new page in the Blockchain ledger. 
<br>
<br>Finally, bitcoin mining essentially involves solving complex math problems. It is the Math behind this currency that
<br>gives it its "store of value" property. One can compare the algorithms involved in bitcoin to the algorithms used by
<br>a central bank to manipulate money, to determine relative ablitiy as store of value.
<br>
<br>Hopefully sufficiently technically accurate- definitely the intro I wish I had.
