<h1 style ="text-align:center">A Simple Expanation of Bitcoin</h1>
<p>
After explaining bitcoin a few times I've found the best way to begin is to think like an Economist.

The properties of anything identified as "money" include:
-Store of value
...Will it hold its value over time?
-Medium of exchange
...Can I use it as an intermediary in exchanging goods/services to get what I want?
-Unit of Account
...(essentially) Can it be measured as a discrete value? (as opposed to continuous)

The dollar bill is a "promissory note" and doesn't hold value itself. It is useful to think of it as 
promising the bearer of the note a certain amount of gold, held in a bank's reserves. Over time, as 
the note became used by more and more people, the note itself could be exchanged. The merchant had 
so much faith the note would be backed by gold, he was willing to accept the note in exchange for his
goods.

A bitcoin follows the same three properties. If the architecture regarding the coin and its distribution
are sound, people will begin to place faith in it for transacting. If there are certain advantages to 
transacting in bitcoin (i.e. anonymity or greater percieved store of value), it will compete favorably
against other currencies and its adoption will spread. The dollar value of bitcoin can be thought of as
an account of its ability to satisfy the three properties of money.

Note: This analysis ignores speculation.

Bitcoin has a Blockchain, a global ledger of every transaction  in history. A transaction is conducted between 
wallets, alphanumeric strings which are (at least speciously) difficult to attribute to a person.  A Bitcoin miner
(the human with the computing equipment) donates his computing power and pays for electricity, hoping in turn
he will get a bitcoin. To the miner, a bitcoin is a reward for adding an additional page to the ledger so 
additional people can transact. If I was to try to send you a coin, I would need to wait for a page to be added
to validate our transaction.

Bitcoins are limited, and computation becomes harder (i.e. costs more electricity/time) over time. Once the supply
has run out, miners will mine for a "transaction fee" from the people who use the new page in the Blockchain ledger. 

Finally, bitcoin mining essentially involves solving complex math problems. It is the Math behind this currency that
gives it its "store of value" property. One can compare the algorithms involved in bitcoin to the algorithms used by
a central bank to manipulate money, to determine relative store of value.

Hopefully sufficiently technically accurate- definitely the intro I wish I had.
